title: Proto GraphQL API
---

There is a proposal for [generating protobuf requests and responses for GraphQL queries](https://github.com/google/rejoiner/issues/43)
at client build time. The client can use the proto to make a GraphQL request to
the server using gRPC. The server will receive the request proto message along
with the full query string and can infer the request/response protos at query
time.
